Peter and I had a chat about what we want this reservation system to do and here are some points:

1. Need various database tables behind it: (Guests, Prices, Bookings) *DONE*
2.	A Check Availability Button takes them to a Calendar where they can see 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, or 12 months **IN PROGRESS - CURRENTLY next and previous months **

3.	Existing Bookings are shown in one colour, available days in another **DONE**
4.	When someone clicks on a From date and To Date the boxes fill with another colour **DONE but CHANGED**

	##	Now one clicks on the first date, then selects a 'length of stay' option and the entire group of cells are selected		##
		
5.	They can then click a 'Start your Booking' button which presents a form to collect the following information:

	BOOKING INFORMATION
	Number of Adults:      Children: **DONE**
	Arrival Date: (defaulted in from Calendar) **DONE**
	Departure Date: (defaulted in from Calendar) *** WAITING for MUM***
	Number of Days: (calculated by the program) **DONE** 
	Payment Method:  Visa, Mastercard, Eftpos, Direct Debit **DONE**

Then a button similar to 'Calculate my Stay' presents them with a confirmation of what they are paying for as well as the calculated costs.

6. Another button asks if they want to 'Book Now?'
7. Checkbox for Terms and Conditions (mandatory before they can continue)
8. Clicking the Book Now? button presents a Contact Details form to capture the following information and would include the booking details from the Booking Information form:

	BOOKING REQUEST
	Contact Information
	First Name
	Last Name
	Address
	Phone
	Mobile
	Email
	Dietary Requirements (if any)

	Booking Information
	Information entered on the Booking Information form would default in here (and would be non-maintainable)

	Comments
	A text area for any questions or comments

9. Clicking a 'Send your Reservation Request' button does the following:
	Emails the Booking Request to us
	Emails a copy to the Customer
	Puts a message up telling them that the Booking Request has been made and that we will contact them to confirm the booking and accept payment. 
	(The Booking cannot be confirmed until payment is made)
	Adds a record to the booking database with a tentative status.  The status will be tentative until we contact them and they make the payment.


10. Make a system to make days unavailable to customers from Admin page. **DONE**
11. Weekend/Weekday prices... eg. every saturday default price.. etc. **DONE**
12. Admin page calendar with ability to click on a date and see the reservation **DONE**
